# üåä Lake Risk Clustering using HDBSCAN

This project performs **unsupervised clustering on U.S. lake ecosystem data** using **HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)** to identify **high-risk clusters** influenced by agricultural and urban pressures.  
The analysis aims to provide **data-driven insights** into **regional environmental vulnerability**, helping stakeholders understand how human activity impacts water quality and ecological resilience.

## üìò Overview

Lakes are crucial ecosystems that regulate biodiversity and provide resources for agriculture, recreation, and human consumption.  
However, **anthropogenic pressures** ‚Äî such as **urban expansion** and **intensive agriculture** ‚Äî can significantly alter their ecological balance.

This project leverages **machine learning clustering (HDBSCAN)** to uncover **patterns of ecological risk** among lakes, classifying them based on multidimensional indicators like:
- Water quality,
- Agricultural activity,
- Urban development,
- And environmental pressure metrics.

## üéØ Objectives

- Identify **natural groupings** among lakes using unsupervised learning.
- Detect **high-risk clusters** with degraded environmental quality.
- Provide **data insights** that can inform sustainable ecosystem management.
- Compare clustering results with **geographical or anthropogenic patterns**.

## üß† Methodology

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Raw dataset: `data.csv`
- Variables include: lake clarity, agricultural index, urban pressure, connectivity, etc.
- Conducted data cleaning, scaling, and normalization using **pandas** and **scikit-learn**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clustering Algorithm
- Applied **HDBSCAN** due to its ability to:
  - Detect clusters of varying density,
  - Handle noise/outliers,
  - Avoid manual `k` selection (unlike K-Means).
- Parameter tuning with `min_cluster_size` and `min_samples`.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation
- Compared with **K-Means** and **DBSCAN** to assess robustness.
- Evaluated results using:
  - **Silhouette Score**
  - **Cluster Stability**
  - **Visualization (PCA / t-SNE projections)**

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization
- Cluster mapping using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
- Heatmaps, scatter plots, and cluster profiles to interpret ecosystem differences.

## üß© Key Results

- HDBSCAN successfully identified **10 clusters** with varying ecological risk.
- **Cluster 2** showed the **highest vulnerability**, characterized by:
  - Low water clarity,
  - High agricultural intensity,
  - Dense urban surroundings.
- Visualization confirmed a clear **gradient between natural and disturbed ecosystems**.

> üß≠ These insights highlight the link between land use and lake ecosystem health, providing a foundation for sustainable management strategies.
